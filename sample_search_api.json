Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a\n            pivotal role, contributing significantly to the nation’s\n            gross domestic product (GDP) and accounting for 90 percent\n            of the labor force. Enterprises must scale their climate\n            action to meet Kenya’s climate mitigation and adaptation\n            goals. However, the lack of funding has limited their\n            contribution to the climate agenda. Debt constitutes most of\n            enterprises’ funding, but the price of debt remains very\n            high and loan tenors are short. The availability of patient\n            capital, including private equity, is also low. Carbon\n            markets can be an important vehicle to support an\n            enterprise’s climate action. Crucially, carbon markets\n            function as a source of non-debt, results-based financing\n            that does not require prior assets or collateral,\n            potentially enabling enterprises in Kenya that struggle to\n            access other sources of climate finance to grow. Despite\n            this potential and the government of Kenya’s commitment to\n            scale carbon markets, Kenya’s participation in international\n            carbon markets remains concentrated, with most credits\n            issued by a handful of developers. Many enterprises also\n            have limited understanding on how they should develop and\n            monetize carbon credits. The purpose of this guidebook is\n            therefore to provide practical step-by-step guidance to help\n            enterprises navigate the complex and fast-evolving landscape\n            of carbon markets."},"display_title":"A Carbon Market Guidebook for\n            Kenyan Enterprises","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040424053541073/pdf/P1796801e6f92d053187b01916665fc998d.pdf","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040424053541073/text/P1796801e6f92d053187b01916665fc998d.txt","listing_relative_url":"/research/2024/04/34295591/carbon-market-guidebook-kenyan-enterprises","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040424053541073/P1796801e6f92d053187b01916665fc998d","new_url":"2024/04/34295591/P1796801e6f92d053187b01916665fc998d","disclstat":"Disclosed","guid":"099040424053541073","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040424053541073/P1796801e6f92d053187b01916665fc998d"},"D34295600":{"id":"34295600","authors":{"0":{"author":"Watkins,Joanna Alexandra"}},"count":"Lesotho","docna":{"0":{"docna":"Disclosable Version of the ISR -

Traditionally, the\n            incidence of fiscal policy is assessed for households along\n            the income distribution. In an attempt to tease out the\n            gendered impacts of the fiscal system, this paper instead\n            looks at how much different types of households in Jordan\n            contribute to and benefit from current fiscal policies and\n            the extent to which the fiscal system is helping to equalize\n            post-market outcomes within and across groups. A household\n            typology is constructed for Jordan based on households’\n            demographic characteristics, which not only determine which\n            taxes and transfers a household experiences, but also\n            influence the participation of women in economic activity\n            outside the household because they affect the generation and\n            allocation of care responsibilities. The paper shows that\n            the receipt of in-kind benefits, primarily education, is\n            what drives which groups that receive the largest net\n            benefits from the fiscal system. The results also show that\n            the fiscal system in Jordan is reducing within-group\n            inequalities, which represent over 80 percent of total\n            inequality for both fiscal and care groups. The fiscal\n            system has a limited impact on inequalities across groups,\n            but they are very small."},"colti":"Policy Research working paper ; no.

There are six\n            components to the project, the first component being\n            Enabling environment for the establishment of an African\n            SDM. This component will support AU´s strategic vision of\n            creating an SDM in Africa by 2030 through the development of\n            appropriate policies and regulations for coordinated digital\n            transformation in Africa. This component includes two\n            subcomponents: Legal and regulatory environment for a\n            continental SDM, and Institutional capacities for a\n            continental SDM. The second component is the connectivity\n            market development and integration. This component aims to\n            develop and integrate the regional connectivity market in a\n            way that encourages private sector competition and\n            investments. This component includes two subcomponents:\n            legal, regulatory, and institutional capacity for\n            telecommunications sector and digital economy, and\n            international and core backbone network infrastructure. The\n            third component is the data market development and\n            integration. This component aims to build trust in online\n            transactions and strengthen the security and resilience of\n            digital infrastructure and systems as a prerequisite for a\n            functional SDM. This component includes two subcomponents:\n            data safeguards: Legal, regulatory, and institutional\n            capacity for cybersecurity and data protection, and data\n            enablers: Data regulations for regional data flow and data\n            infrastructure. The fourth component is the online market\n            development and integration. This component aims to promote\n            creation, access and delivery of digital goods and services\n            seamlessly and freely across the region. This component\n            includes three subcomponents: digital adoption for regional\n            integration: e-commerce, digital entrepreneurship, and\n            digital skills, access to and use of digital financial\n            services, and digital government services for regional\n            integration. The fifth component is the project management\n            and implementation support. This component will finance\n            support to the recipients’73 project management and\n            implementation of project associated activities, including\n            procurement, financial management (FM), monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E), project communication, environmental\n            and social safeguards, and citizen engagement. Finally, the\n            sixth component is the contingent emergency response\n            component. The project will include a contingent emergency\n            response component to help participating countries respond\n            swiftly to eligible crises and emergencies."},"display_title":"Western and Central Africa -\n            Digital Transformation for Africa (DTfA)/ Western Africa\n            Regional Digital Integration Program SOP1 : Annex 3 -\n            Technical Note : Support for Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099628104032444279/pdf/IDU18d3d4a4c16031a10c1cd4886ee6c6f.pdf","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099628104032444279/text/IDU18d3d4a4c16031a10c1cd4886ee6c6f.txt","listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2024/04/34295176/western-central-africa-digital-transformation-africa-dtfa-western-africa-regional-digital-integration-program-sop1-annex-3-technical-note-support-climate-change-adaptation-mitigation","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099628104032444279/IDU18d3d4a4c16031a10c1cd4886ee6c6f","new_url":"2024/04/34295176/IDU18d3d4a4c16031a10c1cd4886ee6c6f","disclstat":"Disclosed","guid":"099628104032444279","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099628104032444279/IDU18d3d4a4c16031a10c1cd4886ee6c6f"},"D34295319":{"id":"34295319","authors":{"0":{"author":"Borrowing Agency"}},"count":"Ethiopia","docna":{"0":{"docna":"Additional Financing Environmental and\n            Social Commitment Plan (ESCP) -

Yet many countries struggle\n            to meet even routine demands for health care. Climate\n            change, disasters, pandemics, and demographic changes are\n            bound to increase pressures on already strained health\n            systems (Rentschler et al. 2021). Preparing and equipping\n            health systems to adequately respond to crises are vital to\n            ensure sustained access to health services and to provide\n            reliable essential health care that protects people’s\n            well-being. Having a robust assessment of their country’s\n            health system’s climate and disaster risk management (CDRM)\n            capabilities allows policy makers to make these systems more\n            resilient against shocks. This policy note introduces the\n            Frontline Scorecard, a new rapid diagnostic tool that\n            decision makers can use to conduct a high-level assessment\n            of the CDRM capabilities of their health system, and\n            illustrates its application in a case-study country, Belize."},"display_title":"The Frontline Scorecard -

As a result, they developed a unique and ambitious\n            outreach program to involve communities and implement the\n            project in direct collaboration with beneficiaries from\n            targeted neighborhoods. The project stands out for the way\n            in which it has fully folded citizen engagement into its\n            theory of change and addressed technical and social issues\n            as joint challenges. It may inspire other projects to\n            proactively seek to identify areas where lack of engagement\n            acts as a binding constraint and to craft strategies to\n            empower beneficiaries and project-affected people and make\n            them co-owners of the project’s outcomes."},"display_title":"Distribution Grid Modernization\n            and Loss Reduction Project in the Dominican Republic :\n            Citizen Engagement Good Practice Case Study","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099656404032432777/pdf/IDU160006a2312eac14f5d18dab12fd163fbd6d4.pdf","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099656404032432777/text/IDU160006a2312eac14f5d18dab12fd163fbd6d4.txt","listing_relative_url":"/research/2024/04/34294659/distribution-grid-modernization-loss-reduction-project-dominican-republic-citizen-engagement-good-practice-case-study","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099656404032432777/IDU160006a2312eac14f5d18dab12fd163fbd6d4","new_url":"2024/04/34294659/IDU160006a2312eac14f5d18dab12fd163fbd6d4","disclstat":"Disclosed","guid":"099656404032432777","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099656404032432777/IDU160006a2312eac14f5d18dab12fd163fbd6d4"},"D34294834":{"id":"34294834","authors":{"0":{"author":"Kazi,Swarna"}},"count":"Bangladesh","docna":{"0":{"docna":"Appraisal Project Information Document (PID)"}},"docty":"Project Document","seccl":"Public","lang":"English","entityids":{"entityid":"34294834"},"docdt":"2024-04-03T00:00:00Z","display_title":"Appraisal Project Information\n            Document (PID)","pdfurl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040324085035887/pdf/P5012741a64fd20518d121ffaa13717cde.pdf","txturl":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040324085035887/text/P5012741a64fd20518d121ffaa13717cde.txt","listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2024/04/34294834/appraisal-project-information-document-pid","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040324085035887/P5012741a64fd20518d121ffaa13717cde","new_url":"2024/04/34294834/P5012741a64fd20518d121ffaa13717cde","disclstat":"Disclosed","guid":"099040324085035887","url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099040324085035887/P5012741a64fd20518d121ffaa13717cde"},"D34295009":{"id":"34295009","authors":{"0":{"author":"Borrowing Agency"}},"count":"Kenya","docna":{"0":{"docna":"Labor Management Procedures Second Kenya\n            Devolution Support Program (P180935)"}},"docty":"Procedure and Checklist","subsc":"Public Administration -
