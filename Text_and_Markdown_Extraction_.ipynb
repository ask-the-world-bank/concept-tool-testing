    "# PDF Text Extraction Program Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains a Python program designed to perform text extraction from a series of PDF documents. The program reads a list of PDF file paths from a text file, processes each PDF to extract text while considering specific formatting rules, and saves the extracted text into a Markdown file in the same directory as the original PDF. The process aims to detect headings and subheadings based on font sizes and styles, adjust text flow, and maintain a logical reading order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PyMuPDF Library**: The program utilizes PyMuPDF (fitz) for handling PDFs. Ensure PyMuPDF is installed using `pip install PyMuPDF`.\n",
    "- **Python 3**: Written for Python 3, compatibility with previous versions is not guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reading PDF Paths**: Initially, the program reads a file named `pdfs_to_extract.txt`, which contains the local paths to all PDFs to be processed. Each line in this file represents one path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PDF Processing**:\n",
    "    - For each PDF, the program:\n",
    "        - Opens the PDF and iterates through each page.\n",
    "        - Calculates and applies a half-inch margin to ignore texts close to the edges.\n",
    "        - Extracts text blocks within the defined margins.\n",
    "        - Sorts the extracted text blocks into a logical reading order based on their positions.\n",
    "        - Adjusts text flow by removing hyphenated line breaks and unnecessary whitespace.\n",
    "        - Applies basic Markdown formatting for detected headings and subheadings (additional implementation required for full functionality).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Markdown File Generation**:\n",
    "    - After processing, the extracted text for each PDF is saved into a Markdown (.md) file.\n",
    "    - The Markdown file is named after the original PDF and stored in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Processing Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Margin Adjustment**: A half-inch margin from each page's edge is considered non-essential and ignored during text extraction to focus on the main content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Flow Adjustment**: Hyphenated words at line breaks are joined to ensure smooth text flow. Paragraph breaks are denoted with double newlines for Markdown compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heading Detection**: While the basic framework for detecting headings based on font sizes and styles is outlined, detailed implementation requires further development. Headings are intended to be marked with appropriate Markdown tags (e.g., `#` for main headings, `##` for subheadings).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepare a text file named `pdfs_to_extract.txt` with paths to the PDF files you wish to process.\n",
    "- Ensure all dependencies are installed and run the cells in this notebook.\n",
    "- Processed text will be available in Markdown format in the same directory as the source PDFs.\n"
